# BackGammon

This is a console based backgammon game! Game software is developed via C++ upon an object oriented concept.


## Project Scheme

All source(.cpp) and header(.hpp) files are placed inside the source folder **src**. There is also **GameView** folder that contains some gameplay scenes but I do not prefer to add to the repo. So it is ignored inside gitignore. Besides there are also **Makefile** and **README** files.
